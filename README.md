My personal website.

This is my first solo project. I built my website from scratch with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, & CSS.

I used my own books as well as tutorials and resources found on the internet.

In addition to my featured portfolio pieces, all the art and photography for the creation of this website, including the logo, were created by myself with Photoshop and Illustrator.
